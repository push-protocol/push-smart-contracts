# Push Protocol Smart Contracts

Welcome to the repository for the smart contracts of the Push Protocol. This repository contains the core code that powers our decentralized communication network. The Push Protocol is a web3 communication protocol that enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for decentralized applications (dApps), wallets, and services.

Our smart contracts are the backbone of the Push Protocol, enabling the functionality that allows for on-chain and off-chain communication via user wallet addresses. This is done in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform-agnostic fashion.

In this repository, you will find the contracts that handle various aspects of the Push Protocol, from channel creation and verification to notification sending and subscription handling. We also provide a suite of tests to ensure the robustness and security of our contracts.

We invite you to explore, contribute, and help us build the future of web3 communication.

| EPNSCoreStorageV2.sol   | The provided code defines a contract called EPNSCoreStorageV2 that has three state variables. It defines two types of byte32 hash constants and mappings for nonces, channel update counters and rewards claimed by addresses for channel creation. It specifies the Solidity compiler version to be used as greater than or equal to 0.6.0 and less than 0.7.0.                                                                                                                           | contracts/EPNSCore/EPNSCoreStorageV2.sol   |
| EPNSCoreAdmin.sol       | The code defines a contract called EPNSCoreAdmin that imports "ProxyAdmin" from the "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/" package. The contract defines no behavior of its own and essentially acts as a forwarding service that allows an admin to upgrade other contacts via a proxy. It is licensed under MIT.                                                                                                                                                                               | contracts/EPNSCore/EPNSCoreAdmin.sol       | 
| TempStorage.sol         | The provided code is for a Solidity smart contract called TempStorage, which serves as a temporary storage for channels whose poolContribution and weight have been updated. It uses a mapping data structure to keep track of updated channels and has two functions that allow users to check if a channel has been adjusted and to mark a channel as adjusted, respectively. The constructor function sets the Core_Address of the contract and requires that it be a non-zero address. | contracts/EPNSCore/TempStorage.sol         |
| EPNSCoreStorageV1_5.sol | This Solidity contract defines the storage layout for an Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). It includes various enums, constants, mappings, and state variables to keep track of channels created by users, historical data, fair share ratios, fee calculations, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | contracts/EPNSCore/EPNSCoreStorageV1_5.sol |
